Pin Connections:

IR Sensor:
VCC (Power) → 5V on Arduino
GND (Ground) → GND on Arduino
OUT (Signal) → Digital Pin 2 on Arduino
b. WAP in Python/C++ Language to Blink LED
Here’s a simple program in C++ for Arduino to blink an LED connected to pin 13.

C++ Code for Arduino: Blink LED

cpp
Copy code
// Define the pin number for the LED
const int ledPin = 13;

void setup() {
  // Initialize the digital pin as an output
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  // Wait for a second
  delay(1000);
  // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  // Wait for a second
  delay(1000);
}
If you want to use Python with a Raspberry Pi, you can use the following code to blink an LED connected to GPIO pin 18.

Python Code for Raspberry Pi: Blink LED

python
Copy code
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# Set the GPIO mode
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Define the pin number for the LED
led_pin = 18

# Set up the LED pin as an output
GPIO.setup(led_pin, GPIO.OUT)

try:
    while True:
        # Turn the LED on
        GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.HIGH)
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second
        # Turn the LED off
        GPIO.output(led_pin, GPIO.LOW)
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # Clean up GPIO settings on exit
    GPIO.cleanup()
c. Observations on Input and Output

Observations:

Input: The program does not take any user input; it runs continuously until interrupted.
Output: The LED connected to the specified pin blinks on and off every second. The visual output can be observed directly on the LED.
d. Result and Conclusion
Result:

The LED successfully blinks on and off at one-second intervals, demonstrating the basic functionality of digital output on the Arduino Uno or Raspberry Pi.
Conclusion:

The experiment successfully illustrated how to control an LED using a microcontroller (Arduino Uno or Raspberry Pi). This fundamental concept is crucial for understanding how to interface various sensors and actuators in embedded systems. The ability to control outputs based on inputs is a foundational skill in electronics and programming, paving the way for more complex projects involving sensors, motors, and other devices.
